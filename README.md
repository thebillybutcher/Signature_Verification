# Locally Weighted Enhanced DTW Based Online Signature Verification 

In this paper, we present enhance Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW) based method on the online Signature Verification
(SV) by employing the code-vectors generated from Vector Quan-
tization (VQ) to match the aligned pairs in the warping path.
The DTW based method is used to compute the distance score
between the test signature and the genuine enrolled signatures,
for the decision making. In order to improve the results, we
conducted the evaluation using MCYT-100 database and obtained
an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.55% and SVC-2004 database
provides the EER of 2.73%. In this work, we exploit the
characteristics of the warping path for online SV and obtained
enhanced efficacy of the system.
